The hosting service
====================

What is a hosting service
-------------------------

If you followed the steps described in the :ref:`previous pages <sphinx>` of this tutorial, you should have been able to generate **HTML pages** starting from reST documents, using Sphinx.

Those HTML pages though are stored **locally** in your computer memory; you may want them to be publicly available **on the web**. That's when hosting services come into play.

A **hosting service** is what allows you to host your documentation on a server and let it be accessible publicly. 

In this tutorial you will learn how to deploy your documentation in three different platforms: :ref:`GitHub <github>`, :ref:`GitLab <gitlab>` and :ref:`Read the Docs <readthedocs>`.   

.. _github:

Exercise 1: Host your pages on GitHub
---------------------------------------

*   **Step 1**: create a ``documentation.yml`` file.

Add the path ``.github/workflows`` to your project and create a file named ``documentation.yml`` inside, with the following content:

.. code-block:: yaml
	:linenos:

	name: documentation

	on: [push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch]

	permissions:
	  contents: write

	jobs:
	  docs:
	    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
	    steps:
	      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
	      - uses: actions/setup-python@v3
	      - name: Install dependencies
	        run: |
	          pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme myst_parser
	      - name: Sphinx build
	        run: |
	          sphinx-build source build
	      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
	        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
	        if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}
	        with:
	          publish_branch: gh-pages
	          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
	          publish_dir: build/
	          force_orphan: true
			  
			 
The important line is the one that contains the ``sphinx-build`` instruction. The syntax of this instruction is

.. code-block:: bash

	sphinx-build <sourcedir> <outputdir> 
	
and in our example the source directory is called ``source`` while the output directory is called ``build``. The names of the source and output directory may be different, so make sure that the file contains the correct references to these directories.


*	**Step 2**: configure GitHub Pages.

Once you add this file to your project repository and push it on GitHub, a **new branch** called ``gh-pages`` will be created.

On GitHub, you then have to go to **Settings > Pages**, select **"deploy from a branch"** under the section **"Build and deployment"**, select the branch ``gh-pages`` and save changes.

.. figure:: ./settings.png
   
   Go to "Settings" on the upper toolbar


.. figure:: ./pages.png
   :scale: 50 
   
   Go to "Pages" on the left sidebar
   
   
.. figure:: ./deploy-branch.png

   Select "deploy from a branch" and "gh-pages"


The **deployment** of the documentation will start automatically and you can acces your website by navigating to **Actions > Deployments**.


*	**Step 3**: push changes to your GitHub repository.

GitHub Pages will deploy your documentation **every time you push** changes on your repository.


.. _gitlab:

Exercise 2: Host your pages on GitLab
---------------------------------------

.. note:: 

	We will suppose that you have a repository with the same content as your GitHub repository in GitLab.

*   **Step 1**: create a ``.gitlab-ci.yml`` file.

Create a ``.gitlab-ci.yml`` file with the following content:

.. code-block:: yaml
	:linenos:

	image: python:3.7-alpine

	test:
	  stage: test
	  script:
	  - pip install -U sphinx
	  - sphinx-build -b html source public
	  rules:
	    - if: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME != $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
    
	pages:
	  stage: deploy
	  script:
	  - pip install -U sphinx
	  - sphinx-build -b html source public
	  artifacts:
	    paths:
	    - public
	  rules:
	    - if: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH

As in the GitHub example above, the important line is the one that contains the ``sphinx-build`` instruction. Make sure that the directory where you keep all your plain-text files is called ``source`` or change the path accordingly. Notice that now the output directory is called ``public`` instead of ``build``, but that doesn't matter: this directory **will not** be part of your repository anyway; it's a directory created and used internally by GitLab to deploy the website and you don't need to have access to it.

The deployment of the website will start automatically once you add and push this file to your repository.

*   **Step 2** Visit your website.

You can visit your website navigating to **Deploy > Pages** from the left sidebar.

.. image:: ./gitlab-pages.png
   :scale: 50

.. Se modifichi il path del progetto con username.gitlab.io, (attenzione: modificare config della cartella locale) allora puoi visitare il sito su https://username.gitlab,io


.. _readthedocs:

Exercise 3: Host your pages on Read the Docs
--------------------------------------------

*   **Step 1**: sign up on Read the Docs with GitHub. 

Sign up on `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.com>`_  with your **GitHub** account. Read the docs will now have acces to your repositories on GitHub.

*   **Step 2**: add a configuration file.

Add a ``.readthedocs.yaml`` file in your project's repository with the following content:

.. code-block:: yaml
	:linenos:

	# .readthedocs.yaml
	# Read the Docs configuration file
	# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html for details

	# Required
	version: 2

	# Set the OS, Python version and other tools you might need
	build:
	  os: ubuntu-22.04
	  tools:
	    python: "3.12"
	    # You can also specify other tool versions:
	    # nodejs: "19"
	    # rust: "1.64"
	    # golang: "1.19"

	# Build documentation in the "docs/" directory with Sphinx
	sphinx:
	  configuration: source/conf.py

	# Optionally build your docs in additional formats such as PDF and ePub
	# formats:
	#    - pdf
	#    - epub

	# Optional but recommended, declare the Python requirements required
	# to build your documentation
	# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/reproducible-builds.html
	# python:
	#    install:
	#    - requirements: docs/requirements.txt

Notice that Read the Docs wants to know the path to the ``conf.py`` document: make sure the path to this file is correct.

*	**Step 3**: push changes to your GitHub repository.

**Read the Docs** will deploy your documentation **every time you push** changes on your GitHub repository.
