Basics of technical documentation: a project for the "Abilità informatiche" class
=================================================================================

This is the **project** related to the **"Abilità informatiche"** class.

The **goals** of the project were: 

1.	to **explore** some of the tools available to generate technical documentation;
2.	to use those tools to **generate technical documentation** about a chosen topic, **and deploy it** in the form of a website;
3.  to **create a report** describing the job done.


The topic chosen to fulfill the second goal was *the process of creating technical documentation* itself. In this way, tehcnical documentation written on this topic and deployed as a website can serve simultaneously as the **final product** of the project and as the **report** of the project, so as to meet the second goal and the third goal of the assignment at the same time. 

So, the website you are looking at right now is the final product / final report of the project. The content that you will find here is intended as a **tutorial** that will guide you through the process of collecting and using the tools to write, manage and host your documentation.
