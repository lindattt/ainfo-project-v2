Overview
--------

Welcome to the **tutorial** on how to create technical documentation.

In this tutorial you will learn **how to write and manage documentation** for your code.

To start, you'll just need to have a text editor and basic knowledge of shell commands.

In order to generate your own documentation, those are the **tools** that you will need:

*   a :ref:`version control platform <git>`, like **GitHub** or **GitLab**;
*   a :ref:`documentation compiler <sphinx>`, like **Sphinx**;
*   a :ref:`markup language <markup>`, like **reStructured Text**;
*   a :ref:`hosting service <host>`, like **Read the docs** or the **Git platforms** theirselves.

To make your experience more fluent and personal, you may also like to have a look on:

*	:ref:`Org-mode <orgmode>`, a major mode for *GNU Emacs* text editor, a markup language and much more;
*	how to change and customize :ref:`themes <temi>` in your webpage.
